## TCS Enthusiast at IIIT-Delhi

I am currently a sophomore at [IIIT-Delhi](http://iiitd.ac.in/) pursuing a BTech in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics. I see myself eventually working as a researcher in Theoretical Computer Science / Discrete Mathematics.

## YSK

- I am the Founding Coordinator of Ã‰variste, the Math club of IIITD. Visit our website: [bit.ly/EvaristeClub](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathiiitd/wiki/index)
- I am the Student Senate representative for my CSAM batch, 2018-19.

## Projects
### Guillotine cuts | Prof Rajiv Raman
Since Jan 2018 I have been working on Guillotine Cuts for Axis Parallel Rectangles. The general problem dates back to the paper [Cutting Glass](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336223) [Pach et al] but the specific problem we're working on is presented directly in [On Guillotine Cutting Sequences](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5291/) [Abed et al]. In particular, we want to know if one can always save $\Omega(n)$ rectangles and exactly what fraction is feasible. Further, we would also like to eventually examine the problem algorithmically, and try to provide efficient algorithms for finding an optimal guillotine cut.
