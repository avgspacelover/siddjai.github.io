## TCS Enthusiast

I see myself eventually working as a researcher in Theoretical Computer Science / Discrete Mathematics.

## Projects
### Guillotine Cuts (Prof Rajiv Raman)
Since Jan 2018 I have been working on Guillotine Cuts for Axis Parallel Rectangles. The general problem dates back to the paper [Cutting Glass](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336223) [Pach et al] but the specific problem we're working on is presented directly in [On Guillotine Cutting Sequences](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5291/) [Abed et al]. In particular, we want to know if one can always save Omega(n) rectangles and exactly what fraction is feasible. Further, we would also like to eventually examine the problem algorithmically, and try to provide efficient algorithms for finding an optimal guillotine cut.
