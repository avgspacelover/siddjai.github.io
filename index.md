TCS Enthusiast

Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) has an amazingly rich literature for me to dive into and intriguing problems for me to solve. I admire TCS because it extends the rigor of Mathematics to computing, which has been a fascination of mine for a long time. Fields of TCS are worth exploring for their own right, like any Math field. Asking fundamental and then incremental questions and finding satisfying answers is a great joy, and one that is amplified in TCS.

I see myself eventually working as a researcher in Theoretical Computer Science / Discrete Mathematics.

Projects

### Guillotine Cuts
#### Prof Rajiv Ramam | Bachelor Thesis
Since Jan 2018 I have been working on Guillotine Cuts for Axis Parallel Rectangles. The general problem dates back to the paper [Cutting Glass](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336223) [Pach et al] but the specific problem we're working on is presented directly in [On Guillotine Cutting Sequences](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5291/) [Abed et al]. In particular, we want to know if one can always save Omega(n) rectangles and exactly what fraction is feasible.

## Experience
#### 2018
### Combinatorics & Graph Theory
####  Prof Samrith Ram | IIIT-Delhi Internship
Selected to study and work on various topics in Combinatorics and Graph Theory during the summer term.

#### 2017
### Graph Theory & Algorithms
#### ACM Summer School | IIT Gandhinagar
I was a scholar selected to study state of the art material from renowned professors. The school had the objective of motivating research and promoting collaboration.
