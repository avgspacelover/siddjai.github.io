title: Over You
layout: post

I'm over you
No, I really am
In years it's been two
But you think it's all a sham
I'm over you
And I can prove it too
I went out with a girl
It didn't end well
I held her, we sat out in a beautiful night
We did everything right
But my heart didn't twirl
Anything but you is a hard sell
I'm over you
Is that why
The only one I wanna tell 
When everything's going well
Even if I have the flu
Or if I wanna cry
Is you
It's always been you
It's always been you
The warmth of our past overwhelms
Even as the spectre of our future looms
Why, why is it so hard to exit this realm
It's like we've been put in different rooms
Even as we hear every move
The other makes
Even as we get this feeling
That we can breach this ceiling
The connection is crude 
And it's so fleeting for fuck's sakes
I'm over you
That's what I need to say
I'm over you
That's how we get through the day
I'm over you 
Lie to you if I may
I'm over you
Somehow I have to stay away
